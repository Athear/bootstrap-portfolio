# Bootstrap Portfolio
A basic portfolio utilizing bootstrap. 

This project was built to familiarize myself with using bootstrap tools for layouts and navigation, as well as provide a framework for a portfolio page.

Currently, all content is placeholder. This will be updated as I complete projects to add to the portfolio.
